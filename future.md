Future dev for PDE-NetGen
=========================

Leverage on sympkf to share the precompilation
----------------------------------------------

large part of the pdenetgen/symbolic tools are similar to the one developped in sympkf, that is more advanced. 
It would be efficient to build `pdenetgen` from `sympkf` (or to develop a precompilation tool in common)
